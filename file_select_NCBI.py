# This python script takes a user supplied text file of sample identifiers found in 
# fastq file names and saves these identifiers to a list; use this list to find and copy relevant fastq files to a user specified directory
# a csv file is written that contains rows for sample identifiers and their forward and reverse read filepaths, respectively

# subset_fastq_files function
def subset_fastq_files(fastq_source_dir, fastq_keep_dir, sample_id_keep_list, fastq_subset_file_list):
    '''
    Function to subset source directory of fastq files based on user provided valid sample IDs.

    Sample IDs provided in 'sample_id_keep_list' will be used to select fastq files using the following criteria:
        * First item (before '_') in fastq file name == 'sample_id'
    
    Example:
        - Files in fastq_source_dir:
            '1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq',
            '2_S13_L001_R1_001.fastq',
            '5_S49_L001_R1_001.fastq'

        - sample_id_keep_list: [ 1, 5 ]

        - fastq_subset_file_list: [
            [ '1', '1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq'  ],
            [ '5', '5_S49_L001_R1_001.fastq' ]
        ]
    
        - New directory containing selected files will be create at 'fastq_keep_dir':
            '1_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq',
            '5_S49_L001_R1_001.fastq'

    Parameters 
    ----------
    fastq_source_dir: Directory containing fastq files (forward or reverse).

    fastq_keep_dir: Copy fastq files to this path if they meet 'keep' criteria.

    sample_id_keep_list: List of user provided sample ids to define 'keep' criteria.

    fastq_subset_file_list: For files that meet 'keep' criteria, append sample id and file name to this list.
